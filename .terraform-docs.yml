  # Terraform Module: Wayfinder on Azure

  The "terraform-azure-wayfinder" Terraform Module can be used to provision and manage a licensed edition of [Appvia Wayfinder](https://www.appvia.io/product/) on Azure.

  ## Requirements

  To run this module, you will need the following:
  1. Product license key: Contact sales@appvia.io for more information.
  2. IDP App configuration details: Wayfinder integrates with an IDP for managing user access. You will need a valid Client ID, Client Secret and Server URL (or Azure Tenant ID) for initial configuration.
  3. A public Azure DNS Zone: This module will create DNS records for the Wayfinder API and UI endpoints, and performs a DNS01 challenge via the LetsEncrypt Issuer for valid domain certificates.
  4. Existing Virtual Network and Subnet: This module will deploy an AKS Cluster and so requires an existing vnet with outbound internet connectivity.

  ### Connecting to an Identity Provider

  Wayfinder integrates with an IDP for managing user access. You will need a valid Client ID, Client Secret and Server URL (or Azure Tenant ID) for initial configuration.

  The Authorized Redirect URI for the IDP Application should be set to: `https://${wayfinder_domain_name_api}/oauth/callback`

  **Note:** If you are using Azure Active Directory, you must:
  1. Set `azureTenantId` to your Azure Tenant ID (`serverUrl` is not required)
  2. Set the IDP type to `aad`

  #### Example: Generic IDP Configuration

  ```hcl
  wayfinder_idp_details = {
    {{ "  " }}type         = "generic"
    {{ "  " }}clientId     = "IDP-APP-CLIENT-ID"
    {{ "  " }}clientSecret = "IDP-APP-CLIENT-SECRET"
    {{ "  " }}serverUrl    = "https://example.okta.com" # Or "https://example.auth0.com/"
  }
  ```

  #### Example: Azure AD IDP Configuration

  ```hcl
  wayfinder_idp_details = {
    {{ "  " }}type          = "aad"
    {{ "  " }}clientId      = "IDP-APP-CLIENT-ID"
    {{ "  " }}clientSecret  = "IDP-APP-CLIENT-SECRET"
    {{ "  " }}azureTenantId = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  }
  ```
